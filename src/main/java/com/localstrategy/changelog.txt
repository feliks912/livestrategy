    Added trailing stoploss on previous candle high / low
    Changed entry strategy - last low / high no longer have to match the lowest low / highest recent high (but new orders can still only be made on a lower low / higher high using usedHigh / usedLow flags)
    The entry price is always ZigZag low / high, no more range.

    Observations:
        More positions - crazy profits, crazy losses.
    
    Todo:
        Increase distance and ZigZag values
        Introduce reversing a trade on stop
            Fixed profit to recouperate loss (depends on stoploss percentage)
        Convert to multi-threaded

    Added latency between order activation and setting a stoploss

    Observation:
        We lost a lot on that one

    Todo: FIXME:
        Currently we place a stop-limit order entry request when when a new stoploss level is recognized, but I forgot to cancel the previous one on new candle formation. That takes 2*trade request latency because we must cancel, then create an order (binance, of course, doesn't support closing and creating a new order in the same request ofc ofc). I must implement the latency those two requests take.

        Also, it takes LONGER for us to get a response from the server because I've been analyzing how long it takes for the exchange to execute and order compared to when the request was sent, not how long it takes for us to receive that response. I've got to test that aswell, then implement it here.

    Reintroduced ranges to entry triggers

    Observations:
        Higher profits

    Todo:
        Introduce BE on a percentage move from the entry price, this way we'll avoid losses where price moves away from entry but hits the stoploss in the same candle. Especially true in volatile markets. Prioritize minimizing losses.

    Added trailing stoploss at a percentage between previous candle close and entry.

    Observations:
        Some days are catastrophically profitable, but on others the losses recouperate

    Todo:
        500000 volume candles just don't seem to cut it on days ~450 to ~700. Try with 2mil.
        TODO: Priority - cut losses
            Loss prevention methods:
                Opposite reordering ?
                Higher distance values
                Higher ZigZag parameter values
                Rollback to matching ZigZag values with highest / lowest values
                Lower risk
                New detection method (but refactor first)
                    Note previous potential limit levels (but don't take them) and only open positions when price crosses that level. Hopefully those are potential reversal levels so them, and onwards would be a good place to start checking for levels
