    Added trailing stoploss on previous candle high / low
    Changed entry strategy - last low / high no longer have to match the lowest low / highest recent high (but new orders can still only be made on a lower low / higher high using usedHigh / usedLow flags)
    The entry price is always ZigZag low / high, no more range.

    Observations:
        More positions - crazy profits, crazy losses.
    
    Todo:
        Increase distance and ZigZag values
        Introduce reversing a trade on stop
            Fixed profit to recouperate loss (depends on stoploss percentage)
