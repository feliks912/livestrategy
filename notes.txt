At event 212761593 order 8691 attempts to repay funds after closing.
Previous short order sold BTC for USDT without borrowing, because we had enough Free BTC to cover the position without borrowing.
Therefore, order 8691 doesn't have enough free BTC to repay.
We must now buy BTC on market to repay order 8691, IF the order which sold the bitcoin without borrowing doesn't close in the meantime.
If the order does close in the meantime, we will have the delta of bitcoin between those two order indefinitely stuck in our account,
Which we would have to sell manually,
If we manage to detect both those events.
